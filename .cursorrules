# Cursor AI Coding Guidelines

## Code Style

- Follow the project's ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use single quotes for strings (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Always add semicolons
- Use trailing commas in multi-line structures
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation

## Architecture Patterns

- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3-4 levels)
- Extract complex logic into separate functions
- Use early returns to reduce nesting

## Error Handling

- Always handle errors explicitly
- Use try-catch for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Never swallow errors silently
- Use custom error types when appropriate

## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Aim for high code coverage (>80%)
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Keep tests isolated and independent

## Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Keep README files up to date
- Document architectural decisions in ADRs
- Include examples in documentation

## Security

- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Validate and sanitize user input
- Use parameterized queries for databases
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow OWASP security best practices
- Keep dependencies up to date

## Performance

- Avoid premature optimization
- Profile before optimizing
- Use lazy loading when appropriate
- Optimize database queries
- Cache expensive operations
- Minimize bundle size

## Git Practices

- Use conventional commit messages
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Reference issues in commit messages when applicable
- Never commit directly to main/develop branches

## Code Review

- Review your own code before requesting review
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Provide context in PR descriptions
- Address review feedback promptly
- Be respectful and constructive in reviews

## Dependencies

- Prefer well-maintained, popular packages
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Audit dependencies regularly
- Minimize external dependencies
- Document why specific dependencies are chosen

## File Organization

- Group related files together
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep files focused and single-purpose
- Organize imports (external, internal, relative)
- Remove unused imports and code

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain proper color contrast
- Test with screen readers when applicable

## Browser Compatibility

- Support modern browsers (last 2 versions)
- Use feature detection, not browser detection
- Provide fallbacks for unsupported features
- Test across different browsers and devices

## General Principles

- Write code that is easy to read and understand
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Keep it simple (KISS principle)
- Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
- You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI)
